Bay Area Matchbox Collectors Association

This repository contains much of the source code that runs "bamca.org".
There is still much missing but this is a start.  This repository
does not, and will not, contain the pictures from the site.
Absent that, the goal is to have enough recorded here that the
site could be recreated.

Please note that this was written by one person, and was never
intended to be shared or passed on, so the documentation is rare
to nonexistant.  I will be fixing that as I can.

Milestones:

1996 - V1 - This project was started as a page of links to sites
that would be of interest to Matchbox collectors.

1998 - V2 - We bought the domain name, and I started working on the
lineup pages, writing the scripts in PERL.

2000 - V3 - I converted the entire site to Python.

2004ish - V4 - I substantially rewrote the site to use a web framework
and a more cohesive design.

2010 - V5 - The site was rewritten to run off of a MySql database.
There are still some old pages that run off of text files, but
almost everything that has to do with 3-inch models is in the DB.

There are many plans for things to add, but they require time, which
is in short supply.  I'll do them when I can.  The most pressing
projects are to fill in more variation and product pictures, and
to add more models and products to the database.
