<b>Updates from Dean</b><br>
</div>

<div align="left">
February 11, 2018 - Revised a lot of entries for consistancy.  Added a few reported variations.  Moved picture credits into database.<br>
July 2, 2017 - Started adding cab variation numbers.  Fixed several errors found in some of the index pages.<br>
June 16, 2017 - My first pass on rewriting these pages is mostly done.  There will be much more to do in the future but
I feel things are complete enough to publish them.  Added TODO list.<br>
June 14, 2017 - Added CY047A.<br>
June 12, 2017 - Added Collectible Convoys.<br>
June 10, 2017 - Added Team Matchbox and Team Convoy<br>
June 9, 2017 - Added several missing models: CY002A, CY003B, CY011A, CY013A, CY018A, CY018B, CY019A, CY026A, CY028A,
CY036A, CY037A, CY038A, CY104A, CY104B, CY107A, CY109A, CY110A, CY111A, CY112A, CY113A.  Added TP models.<br>
June 8, 2017 - Rewrote everything in sight.  Now looking for things to add.<br>
June 5, 2017 - Removed "year" pages.  There's not yet enough information to support them the way I'd like to.
Also removed the "straight trucks" page, as the BAMCA site cuvers these very well.
June 4, 2017 - After looking for these pages and finding them gone, I got in touch with John.  He was kind enough to
send me a copy of his final snapshot, and gave me permission to modify them as I saw fit.  I am starting the process of
rewriting these and extending them for inclusion on the BAMCA website.<br>
