On January 19, 1947, the company Lesney Products was formed by two (unrelated)
school friends, Leslie Smith and Rodney Smith.  At first they didn't know
what kinds of "products" they would make, nor did either work full-time for
the firm.  With about 600 pounds of seed money, they bought an old tavern in
Edmonton, London, and some surplus government die casting machinery, and
decided to make pressure die casting products for industrial use.  They were
joined by John W. "Jack" Odell, and they started producing small die-cast
components.<p>

During a late-year slowdown, they decided to look for other products they
could make to keep their people and equipment busy.  They experimented with
a few die-cast toys, and in 1948 the first of these, an Aveling-Barford Road Roller,
was produced and sold to a few local London shops.  More toys followed, although
the use of zinc was restricted during the Korean War, 1950-1952, so only the tin
Jumbo The Elephant was produced during this period.<p>

London distributors did not take these toys seriously, but children loved
them and shopkeepers wanted more.  Through 1953 Lesney had produced 17 different
toys.  By late that year, the Lesney management
recognized this market, and established a marketing alliance with Moses
Kohnstam's company Moko to market their toys.<p>

More later.<p>
