Article by <b>Marcel Colijn</b>

<h3>Concept</h3>

The Matchbox Originals form a very collectible range. I collect
these myself and always wanted to write a more in depth article
about the history of these models.
<p>

In 1987 Nick Austin, marketing director of Matchbox Toys, made a
proposal that on the face of it was a stroke of genius.  To celebrate
the alleged 40th anniversary of Matchbox, he proposed the production
of a three-piece limited edition gift set that would feature the
first three miniature Matchbox models made. The idea had a lot going
for it, not the least for the following reasons:

<ul>
<li>It would enable the company to effectively celebrate its 40
years while at the same time prove the strength of its collector
base in terms of offering retrospective packaging of its products
for the first time.
<li>It would also be a good way to reinforce the heritage of the
company with the toy trade while enabling them to gauge whether
there was sufficient interest in the collector fraternity to extend
the concept of reproducing Yesteryear products.
<li>Most importantly, a premium price could be charged for essentially
a very inexpensive item.
</ul>

From the inception of this idea, it was understood within Matchbox
that the pack would not be targeted at children, a market with
little or no interest in (or appreciation of) the significance of
a 40 Year anniversary. Instead, the set would be targeted at all
the Matchbox collectors around the world.
<p>

Within a few weeks the board had accepted the proposal and a strategy
was formulated, based on the assumption that 100,000 sets would be
made and sold. All of the Matchbox markets would announce the pack
at their respective trade toy fairs in early 1988. It had also been
agreed that the styling of the models "should be similar to the
originals, i.e. relativly crude".
<p>

The Research &amp; Development department was briefed to provide
mock-ups. The team leader sourced several examples of each of the
three models and these were broken up to see how they had been made
in 1953. The original models did not exist but the budget had at
least allowed for completely new tooling. In fact, because the
models were relativly simple, the eventual tooling cost stayed under
USD 20,000 per model, about one third of the normal cost for a
miniature.
<p>

Gerry Tekerian, a senior marketing manager, suggested that other
original miniatures be considered. Especially in the light of
comments made by the managing director of Matchbox Toys Italy, who
had written that it was unfortunate that the original Matchbox
models were actually reativly boring subjects! The number of models
to be in the set was increased to five, based on originals from the
1950s. The retail price was set at GBP 14.95 per set and after all
the markets had placed their orders, the revised total production
run was marked at 75,000, with 35,000 going to the UK; 7,000 to
Germany; 8,000 for the international market, including France and
South Africa; 15,000 to the USA and 10,000 to Australia.

<?php PicLink('57-3'); ?>
<?php PicLink('57-4'); ?>
<p>

The set of painted models duly went on sale in November 1987. Using
their original "Matchbox" Series numbers the five models were:
<ul>
<li>No.1 Aveling Barford Road Roller -- green
<li>No.2 Massey Harris Tractor -- red
<li>No.3 London Bus -- "Buy Matchbox Series"
<li>No.7 Horse-drawn Milk Float -- orange
<li>No.9 Dennis F.2 Fire Engine -- red with red escape wheels
</ul>

All five models were painted in the same colour schemes as they had
first appeared in the 1950s. However, the bus had been given new
advertisement labels that read "Buy Matchbox Series". In the first promotion
papers made for the trade the set was pictured with original models
from the 50s!
<p>

<?php PicLink('advert5'); ?>
<p>

The box for the set was actually made with English text and German text. 
<p>

<?php PicLink('naamloos'); ?>
<?php PicLink('setfront2-1'); ?>
<p>

The barcode on the English ones end at 41 while the barcode on
German front text boxes end at 42.  Preproduction examples of the
box with French tect exist but where never futher developed.
Interesting of note also are the preproductions sets made with
models being gold plated. One of these sets is pictured on page 73
of the small Charlie Mack book published by Schiffer (Universal Matchboxs Toys).
It is also featured in the Bruce and Diana Stoneback Matchbox Toys
book.
<p>

<?php PicLink('gold'); ?>
<?php PicLink('gold2'); ?>
<?php PicLink('gold3'); ?>
<?php PicLink('gold4'); ?>
<p>

July 10th 2007, such a set was auctioned at Vectis. It fetched GBP 180 (without commission).
<p>

<?php PicLink('mb18180gbp'); ?>
<br>
(note the French spelling on the box.)
<p>

<h3>Subsequent Sets</h3>

In 1991 these first five models were released but as single pieces
in very good reproduction boxes that accuratly reflected 50s
packaging. Three of the models were now recoloured.
<ul>
<li>dark blue for the Road Roller
<li>green for the Tractor 
<li>pale blue for the Milk Float
</ul>
The Fire Engine has white escape wheels, and the bus has yellow
labels with a Matchbox Originals advertisement. Unlike the 50s models, one
important feature of the new issues was that the metal wheels were
in a bright metal finish, wheras the originals had a dull grey
referred to as "grenadising".
<p>

<?php PicLink('set2'); ?>
<?php PicLink('set2a'); ?>
<?php PicLink('set2c'); ?>
<p>

True to the original originals, there were variations to be found;
for example, double or single canopy supports on the Road Roller
can be seen clearly here in one of Christian's pictures.
<p>
<?php PicLink('MImx104-02-03'); ?>
<p>

The retail price of Series I was GBP 1.99 each.
<p>
This first set of single models with the pale blue Milk Float and
dark blue Road Roller from 1991 were normally available in large
blisters where the models was standing on top of its repro box.
However, in Germany the models were sold without the blisters, 
just in the repro boxes. The repro boxes are different
as there is a barcode on the right end flap, a 3+ logo on front of
the box, and all the trademark and warning information is on the left
end flap and underside of the box.
<p>

This is, of course, because it could not be printed on the blistercard.
The bus on this German box shows the "Players Please" advertisement (yellow
label) while my English boxes show buses with the white Matchbox
Originals labels.
<p>

<?php PicLink('bus'); ?>
<?php PicLink('bus2'); ?>
<?php PicLink('bus3'); ?>
<?php PicLink('bus4'); ?>
<p>

The models themselves always shows the yellow "Matchbox Originals"
labels.
<p>

As these models were sold in Germany without their blisters they
needed a shop display.
<p>

The retailer got a box of 36 models. The top of this box can be
put backwards and erect.  It says: "Matchbox Originals Replikas der
ersten Matchbox autos" which means: "Replicas of the first Matchbox
cars".  It is a very clever item, made from yellow coloured cardboard.
I only saw it for sale twice after I got my own example, so this
shop display is realy difficult to find. Most were probably thrown
away.
<p>

The same set of single models were repacked in a set in 1992.
<p>

<?php PicLink('setfront2'); ?>
<?php PicLink('settop2'); ?>
<?php PicLink('setside2'); ?>
<?php PicLink('setgraphic2'); ?>
<?php PicLink('57'); ?>
<p>

Described as item no. 11964 on the box, it's a very nice box and by
having a window in the front it clearly shows all five
models standing on their reproduction boxes.  This should not be a
difficult set to find.
<p>

<?php PicLink('setback2'); ?>
<p>

For the American market the five models were repacked in plastic
baggies and then put in obnoxious yellow and red checker board box
with Matchbox logo and the text, "The Original Collectibles."
<p>

<?php PicLink('milkfloat'); ?>
<p>

On the backside of these boxes, the Matchbox New Jersey address is
mentioned to the left of the barcode and we can also read: "Made in China
or Macao" (not Macau as it should rightly have been spelled).  I
still do not know why the models were distributed like this way.
These could have been leftovers from the display promotion for the JC
Penney set as described next.
<p>

<?php PicLink('penney'); ?>
<p>

Here again is the same set of five models, all together with a reddish brown
vacuum formed plastic display. There is a white instruction paper. There
is also a yellow label which you can put on the display in the
middle. The repro boxes are flat delivered in the brown cardboard
outher carton. The display instructions are included and the original
box states: "MATCHBOX, Matchbox Toys U.S.A. Ltd. 141 W. Commercial
Ave. Moonachie, N.J. 07074 Cat No. 655-0388, SKU 0000, Item; JCP 5
Pack Originals, MB#11967."
<p>

I have the original price sticker from JC Penney still attached to the
item. The sales price was USD 9.99, reduced from USD 14.99.  I have seen
some of these on internet auctions in the past and it is quite a
difficult item to find, at least in Europe
<p>

A very fragile item so watch out when buying from overseas.
<p>

In 1993 five new models were released. Series II comprised:
<ul>
<li>MX-106 No.6 Quarry Truck -- blue &amp; grey
<li>MX-107 No.13 Wreck Truck -- red &amp; yellow
<li>MX-108 No.19 MGA -- green
<li>MX-109 No.26 Cement Mixer Truck -- orange &amp; grey
<li>MX-110 No.32 Jaguar XK 140 -- black
</ul>

<?php PicLink('series2'); ?>
<p>

The range was increased in 1994 with the release of Series III;
<ul>
<li>MX-111 No.11 Road Tanker -- powder blue
<li>MX-112 No.12 Land Rover -- green
<li>MX-113 No.17 Removal Van -- blue
<li>MX-114 No.18 Caterpillar Bulldozer -- yellow &amp; red
<li>MX-115 No.52 Maserati Racer -- red
</ul>

The factory encountered production problems with the bulldozer model
so the other four were on general release several weeks before the
MX-114. Consequently, as fewer were made, the bulldozer is relativly
scarce today.
<p>

<?php PicLink('series3'); ?>
<?php PicLink('series3a'); ?>
<?php PicLink('series3b'); ?>
<p>

During the period we got this Series III interesting of note is
that Matchbox produced a model for the Australian market.
<p>

<?php PicLink('MImx113-02a'); ?>
<p>

It is the no. 17 Removals Van but in lighter blue and with yellow,
orange and white "Mitre 10 Togther we have done it again" advertisement.
The blister I have for this model is totally different to my other
models in Series III and has no French words on it, but instead a proof of
purchase on the backcard.
<p>

The layout of the trademark section is also totally different. I
haven't seen it for sale for ages but it can eassily be obtained
if you call Matchbox dealers like Paul Carr.
<p>

Also the Bay Area Matchbox Collectors Association issued this
Removals Van as a code 2 model to celebrate the club's 25th anniversary
in 1996.
<p>

<?php PicLink('MImx113-03a'); ?>
<?php PicLink('bamca1'); ?>
<?php PicLink('bamca2'); ?>
<?php PicLink('bamca3'); ?>
<p>

In December 2007, a Belgium Matchbox collector discovered another
packagaing for the Maserati from this Series III.
<p>

<?php PicLink('maserati'); ?>
<p>

The same red model (with diecast body) was introduced in the Heirloom
Collection 10th Anniversary Matchbox Series collection under its
number 52. Not much is known about this promotion. If you can
supply me more information I would be interested. In which year was
this offered during Christmas?
<p>

Series IV, the last Matchbox Originals series of five
models, was released in 1995 and compised the first five models
again but in new colours.

<ul>
<li>No.1 Aveling Barford Road Roller -- orange
<li>No.2 Massey Harris Tractor -- light blue
<li>No.3 London Bus -- "Matchbox Originals" (white label)
<li>No.7 Horse-drawn Milk Float -- dark green
<li>No.9 Dennis F.2 Fire Engine -- red with white escape wheels
</ul>

The 4th set is actually the hardest set to find and numbers produced
must have been far lower. It was certainly not distributed in Holland at
that time (while earlier series were) and it took me over a year
to find these five models.
<p>

<?php PicLink('series4'); ?>
<p>

Over to the Collectible period three more items were produced.
<p>

In the Christmas catalogue of 1995 a four piece set of Matchbox
Originals Holiday ornaments was anounched, with the number YCC03-M for the set.
<p>

<?php PicLink('kerst'); ?>
<?php PicLink('ornam1'); ?>
<?php PicLink('ornam2'); ?>
<p>

The models were:
<ul>
<li>Road Roller -- blue with over the top gold trim
<li>Fire Escape -- with extra black and gold trim
<li>Maserati -- yellow with racing no.1. The painting of this model shows far more detail than previous issues (red model from series III)
<li>Tractor -- green with added gold and black trim (the painting of the driver shows far more detail than previous issues)
</ul>

The tractor and the Maserati are the best in my opinion.  A pity
all four models have extra pins attached to their bodies to hang
them in a Christmas tree; these pins really distract on all
four models.  The models were packed in a white mailer box with
polystyrene inside, and a certificate was included.
<p>

It was not till 2000 that we saw the originals used again.  This time
they were used as a load for one of the Matchbox Collectibles tractor
trailers. It's still one of the more expensive trailers if you find
one on the net.
<p>

<?php PicLink('truck'); ?>
<p>

The Peterbilt 359 is yellow and blue and a no.9 Fire Escape with
chrome ladder wheel and silver ladder with black and silver coloured
driver and a no.26 Cement Mixer in blue with yellow barrel are on
top of their retro boxes packed on the flatbed of the truck.  The
batchcode for this model is 1810 2A and so was produced in July 2000.  The
box for the truck is dark red and this item should have a certificate.
It was marketed as a Dinky Matchbox Exclusive under no. DYM92127.
<p>

The castings were last used for the 50th anniversary commerative
set containing two of the Original models and three other Matchbox
models.
<p>

<?php PicLink('2002set'); ?>
<p>

The Originals are the no.26 Cement Mixer and the no.9 Fire Escape.
These numbers are not printed on the front of the repro boxes and
also some of the trademark text on these repro boxes was deleted.
On the Mixer the gold and black 50th Anniversary logo is printed.
The Fire Escape has red wheels for the ladder and has the 50th
Anniversay logo on the bonnet.
<p>

There should be a commerative plaque unique to this set in the box.
Interesting of note is that the two Original models are pictured
on the backside of the box without the 50th Anniversary logo. The
number of the set is 91943-0718 and I have batchnumber 1802 EA printed
on the backside of the box, so packed in July 2002.
<p>

It was easily available via the Collectible dealers and you can
still find these at swapmeets and on the internet.
<p>

<h3>Points of Sale</h3>
<p>

The Matchbox Toys marketing managers knew from the outset that the
Originals needed shop displays to attract customers and accordingly
two items of display material were sadly destined not to see the
light of day.
<p>

The first was a large carton with a scaled up cut out of the dump
truck standing on it, which was developed by the advertising agency
and intended for free distribution to retailers. This idea did go
beyond the concept stage and indeed only one version in black and
white is known to exist.
<p>

<?php PicLink('blackwhite'); ?>
<p>

The second is a far greater interest to anyone interested in
miniatures as a whole, and indeed is a significant item in the history
of Lesney and Matchbox. A press sheet was discovered in the April
1954 copy of Games and Toys magazine announcing the arrival of the
"Perfect Miniature Series". As you can see the ad consisted of a
display stand illustrating the first six miniatures and it contained
a platform just large enough to display a handful of the new arrivals.
The unit seemed "perfect" in every way and indeed so impressed were
members of the Matchbox Toys sales department that at one stage
they were planning to produce the stand in limited quantities and
sell them as "collector" item.
<p>

One major hurdle was that nobody knew what colour the stand was,
as Games and Toys magazine was printed in black and white. Quite
by chance and several months later a Matchbox collector with good
contacts at Matchbox came across what must be the only surviving
original stand in a private collection.
<p>

It is definitely the first item of display material that Matchbox
produced and most collectors have never even seen one. It stands
as a testament to the completeness of the thinking that went into
the launch of the miniatures all those years ago. The only criticism
that could have been made about the toys was that they did not stand
out on the toy shop shelf or window simply because of their size.
<p>

This would have been a real concern in the early 1950s as the fledgling
company was up against the mighty Dinky Toy range that had more
presence and were regularly supported by many types of attractive
point of sale materials. Additionally, Lesney Products had only
produced five models by this time, which was insignificant when
compared to the hundreds of Binns Road competitors.
<p>

Although not for sale or even loan this Matchbox collector was
allouwed to take some photos for reference and this is one of those
unique pictures.
<p>

<?php PicLink('DSCF0002'); ?>
<p>

This meant that not only were correct colours finally revealed but
the stand could be sized up accurately and in proportion to the
original. This was quickly done as the collector who made the picture
was one of the founders of MICA and had good contacts with Matchbox.
Indeed final artwork was produced but then, disaster! Sales of the
Matchbox Originals fell and the prevailing powers that be deemed
that no futher funds would be allocated to the range. It was argued
that as this was an item to promote the range it should go ahead,
and was indeed on the point of production but the "number jockey"
held off and the project stopped.
<p>

All was not lost however as the artwork and a prototype stand
survived. Having found the long lost artwork, the Matchbox International
Collectors Association (MICA) set about finding out if it could be
used to produce an accurate copy. After a long search, it was handed
over to a semi-retired printer and the answere came back "only
just!" It transpired that in the last few years the printing industry
has moved over to almost entirely to digital technology and that
the days of film from conventional artwork are already a thing of
the past. However, MICA's allies had a contact with a traditional
printer who still used the right equipment, and more importantly
some stock of the right card very similar to that of the original.
<p>

A final consideration was the finishing of the display and in the
end, the printer opted for a semi-matt finish as it was felt that
the gloss commonly used today was not accurate to the period of the
1950's.
<p>

<?php PicLink('displaymb1'); ?>
<p>

This very attractive display unit which perfectly suits the Matchbox
Original series was launched via the MICA magazine (April/May 2005,
June/July 2005).
<p>

Of course, the No.2 Dump and No.3 Cement Mixer were never reproduced
in the Original series so using the original setup as done on the
backcover of MICA magazine, Volume 21, no.1 you have to at least
buy two old models from the fifties. Interesting of note, I think,
is that the setup used in the advertisement on page 276 of MICA magazine
Volume 20, no.6 is different and shows two real no.1 Road Rollers
with their boxes on the shelf while the picture on page 29 MICA
Magazine shows actually the first four models on the shelf. This
photo must have been taken later when all four models were ready.
<p>

I think I am right about this being the advertisement for the April 1954
Games and Toys Magazine while the other advertisement is the announcement
for the Harrogate Fair which I think was in February 1953.
