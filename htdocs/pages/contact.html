<h3>Some Information About Us</h3>
</center>

BAMCA is an informal group of toy vehicle enthusiasts who hold meets  to
buy, sell, and swap miniatures made by Matchbox, Hot Wheels, Dinky, Corgi,
Ertl, Lledo, Majorette, Tomica, and others, as well as related items such
as catalogs and boxes. Collectors can buy, trade, or find new sources for
models. Members share information on new and old cars, favorites and
"worst" models, rare and common items. Above all, BAMCA is a casual group
of collectors who have fun with toy cars.
<p>

Founded in 1971, BAMCA is a local club which welcomes all ages and all
people who like miniature vehicles, regardless of experience or collection
size. The group has something to offer virtually every miniature car
hobbyist, and every individual is a valuable addition to BAMCA and can
make his or her own unique contributions.
<p>

Annual dues for the club are $10.  This annual membership fee covers
postage costs to keep you informed of meetings and other events. Other
benefits of membership include access to information in BAMCA's library
and free admission to meets at members' homes.  Serving the greater San
Francisco Bay Area, BAMCA membership is targeted mainly to enthusiasts who live in
California or can attend meetings in the Bay Area; however, BAMCA also
welcomes correspondence from collectors outside of California.
